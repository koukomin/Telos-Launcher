# Telos Desktop

**Telos Desktop** is a **separate JVM program** (Gradle module `:desktop-linux`). It is not inside the Android APK. On Linux you can unlock the Phantom Vault and run a full **Helix** session (labwc/niri). On Windows (and later macOS) the same binary family opens as a **windowed portable shell** — **Portable Data** by default (config/cache/temp only under a folder next to the jar or `TELOS_PORTABLE_DATA`), no LUKS / labwc. **Host Home** is an explicit opt-in that may leave traces on the PC.

Linux session chrome: KDE-style top bar with glyphs, Kickoff, icon dock, Overview (Meta+Tab), Control Center, toasts, Klassy window buttons, floating Telos apps, and a host `.desktop` launcher. The display manager offers **Telos Desktop** (labwc) and **Telos Desktop (niri)**. After `./install-telos-de.sh`, session files live in `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` and appear in **SDDM**, **GDM**, and **LightDM** login menus. Host windows keep a 36 px top and 56 px bottom reserved band. With host `gtk-layer-shell`, the panel and dock are real Wayland layer surfaces (`telos-layer`); otherwise Telos draws them in Compose. Session notifications use `org.freedesktop.Notifications`. File pickers use the Telos portal (Telos Files picker) when `telos-portal` is running, then gtk. Screencast uses wlr. StatusNotifier tray icons show in the panel tray. Idle locks the session (swayidle, default 5 minutes; media playback inhibits idle). Nested sessions can use the GTK vault greeter; a TTY session still uses the console password. Per-output scale is saved. IME (fcitx5/ibus) and AT-SPI start when installed. Lock uses `loginctl` and PAM, then the vault password. Scale 100–200% is in Settings. Screenshots (panel shot glyph, PrintScreen / Shift+PrintScreen / Ctrl+PrintScreen) use a Spectacle-class flow: full screen, rectangular region or window via host `grim`+`slurp`, `spectacle`, `gnome-screenshot` or `import` when available. Files land under vault `Pictures/Screenshots` (or portable data) as owner-only PNGs (`0600`). Clipboard copy stays off unless you enable it in the shot menu or set `TELOS_SHOT_CLIPBOARD=1`. An optional redaction rectangle can black out private areas before save.

## What it does

| Feature | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Top bar | Plasma-style Helix panel: workspaces 1–4 with subtle neon tint strips under the digits (green / cyan / magenta / orange; off via Settings or `theme.workspaceTints=false`; hidden if panic mute keys are set), clock, audio, network, battery, keyboard/IME layout chip, StatusNotifier tray, clipboard, notifications, screenshot (shot glyph → full / region / window, optional redaction, clipboard opt-in). **Panel surface** modes: transparent, blurred or solid (`panel.surfaceMode`; only the panel root may clear — menus stay opaque). Blurred keeps `panelBlur` and uses a frost plate when host wallpaper backdrop blur is unavailable. **Panel icon contrast** (`panel.iconContrast`: Auto / Light / Dark) samples the wallpaper strip behind the bar on-device and tints Compose Helix glyphs plus tray labels; host `telos-sni` pixmaps are unchanged. Right-click or long-press opens style (surface mode, height, icon size, tint, opacity/blur when relevant, workspace tints, icon contrast). Choices save in vault `desktop.properties`. Control Center includes volume, Wi-Fi, brightness, **Night Light** (warm colour temperature via host `gammastep` / `redshift` / `wlsunset`; preference-only if none are installed; no location services), DND and Settings. |
| Settings | Helix Settings cards for **Theme Studio**, session, display, **Wallpaper accent**, Night Light, desktop (including **Workspace tint strips** and **Panel icon contrast**), **Panel surface** (transparent / blurred / solid Cyber-Tech pills), icons, windows, cursor, profiles, portable, vault and OpSec. Theme Studio sets Quiet Ops / Vault Neon / Paper Ops intensity, neon accents (or “from wallpaper”), Compact / Comfort / Touch density (panel height, icons, snap pills), panel surface mode (`panel.surfaceMode`), panel icon contrast (`panel.iconContrast`), panel opacity, Night Light, and quick icon/cursor picks — keys `theme.intensity` / `theme.accent` / `theme.density` / `panel.surfaceMode` / `panel.iconContrast` in vault `desktop.properties`. Type in **Search settings** to filter cards by title or toggle labels. **Wallpaper accent** (`theme.accent=wallpaper` or `theme.wallpaperTonal=true`, also via Theme Studio) samples the vault/portable wallpaper on this device and derives a Material tonal seed **locally** (digest-cached; neon cyan if sampling fails; pixels are never uploaded). Night Light temperature is stored as `nightLight.enabled` / `nightLight.temperatureK`. Workspace tints use `theme.workspaceTints` (default on). Panel surface uses `panel.surfaceMode` with existing `panelAlpha` / `panelBlur`. Icon contrast uses `panel.iconContrast` (`auto` \| `light` \| `dark`, default `auto`). |
| Cursor | Settings → Cursor picks an installed XCursor/Plasma theme and size (16/24/32/48), or Compose Sweet/Breeze overlay style. Choices save as `cursor.theme` / `cursor.size` in vault `desktop.properties` (portable root on Portable Data — no host HOME writes unless Host Home). On Linux, launched apps get `XCURSOR_THEME` / `XCURSOR_SIZE`; Telos tries to load an XCursor frame into the window cursor and falls back to the Compose overlay. Windows and macOS use stock system cursors only. Optional downloads (BreezeX, Bibata; GPL) go into the session icons folder beside icon packs. |
| AppGrid | Telos logo on the bar (or Super+Space) drops the Kickoff drawer **down from under the top bar**, like Yakuake — it does not replace the whole desktop. The All tab searches Telos apps, `.desktop` files, files under Desktop/Downloads/Documents/Music/Pictures/Videos (vault / Portable Data roots only unless Host Home), calculator (`2+2`), and Flatpak (tap to install). An **opt-in on-device file name index** (Settings → OpSec, off by default) can deepen filename/extension matches; it stores an encrypted blob under `.cache/telos/file-index` with owner-only permissions and never uploads file contents. |
| Command palette | **Super+Period** or **Ctrl+Space** opens the Helix command palette (KRunner / PowerToys Run class): launch apps, jump to open windows, calculator, Open Files / Settings / Network, close the focused window, and paste the last vault clipboard when one exists. The menu is an opaque Cyber-Tech popup. File search stays inside vault / portable roots — it does not index the host home outside the session. |
| Windows | Titlebar drag, 8-edge resize, minimize / maximize / close, shade (double-click titlebar), edge snap. Maximized windows stay below the top bar. **Snap zones:** Super+Left/Right cycles 50/50 → 2/3 → 1/3; Super+Up maximizes; Super+Down restores. Overview and Control Center offer 50/50, 2/3–1/3 and 2×2 pills. Host windows use best-effort `niri msg` / `wmctrl` (and `wlr-randr` for size). |
| Window mode | Control Center, Overview or Settings → **Tiling (niri)** vs **Stacking (labwc)**. Stored as `desktop.windowMode` in vault `desktop.properties`. Applies on the next `telos-session` start when `TELOS_COMPOSITOR` is unset (session desktop files that set the env still win). |
| Files / Media | Folders open in Telos Files (tabs, optional dual pane, shortcuts, new folder, trash). Zip/jar/apk/7z/tar open as folders; split zip (`.z01` next to `.zip`) is one archive; password zips ask once in the window; rar needs host `7z`; ACE needs host `unar` or `unace`. Add smb/sftp places (gio), a Nextcloud/WebDAV URL with user and password, or Nextcloud Login Flow v2 (Integrations): the browser opens, Telos polls for an app password and does not write it to disk. Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive use OAuth with PKCE on `http://localhost:53682/` (Google `127.0.0.1`): paste `dropbox`, `gdrive` or `onedrive` in the network field, your client ID in user, Google client secret in password, then Sign in. Tokens stay in memory until the vault locks. Open a cloud file to download it to a temp folder and open it; long-press saves it to Downloads. Add uploads a file from a picker into the current cloud folder. Media lists Music/Videos/Photos (and Downloads), filter, volume, and playerctl; photos open with `xdg-open`. |
| Telos apps | Files, Photos, Downloads, Trash, Media, Notes, Calendar, Calculator, Clock, **Network** (Status, encrypted DNS preference, DNS block/allow lists + optional NextDNS configuration ID, session firewall allowlist, WireGuard import/start, Tor SOCKS on Linux when `tor`/`wg-quick` are installed), Store (Flatpak list/search/install/uninstall/update, permissions / sandbox tiers when Flatpak is present; Windows winget/scoop backends with confirm install when on PATH; Camera/Mic portal preference; honest degrade when tools are missing), Settings (Camera/Mic portal toggles), System Monitor, System Optimizer. |
| Icon themes | Settings → Icons lists system freedesktop themes already on the machine and packs downloaded through Telos (Papirus, Tela, Candy Icons). Downloads extract into the vault `icons/` folder on Linux, or into `TelosPortableData/icons/` in Portable Data mode (Windows/macOS). Built-in CandyCyber glyphs cover Telos chrome when no disk theme is present. These are desktop themes, not Android launcher icon packs. |
| Deep links | `telos://app/…`, `telos://search?q=…`, and `telos://files?path=…` open Telos apps or Kickoff search. The Linux installer registers `x-scheme-handler/telos`. |
| Quake | `F12` / Ctrl+\` drop-down terminal. |
| System Monitor | `Ctrl+Escape`, reads `/proc` and `/sys`. |

Language follows the JVM locale. Labels are the same keys as the Android launcher (`core/i18n`): Files, Settings, Search, Play, and so on already translated there. The desktop module does not add a second set of translations.

## Build and run

```bash
./gradlew :desktop-linux:packageUberJarForCurrentOS
java -jar desktop-linux/build/compose/jars/telos-desktop-linux-x64-1.0.0.jar
```

Install to `/opt/telos-desktop/telos-desktop.jar` with `sudo` when you want the session launcher to pick it up.

This module never ships in `:app:app`.

## Encrypted session (labwc)

On Linux you can start a full session instead of a window on another desktop:

1. Install `labwc` and a JRE 17+.
2. Build the UberJar.
3. Run `desktop-linux/session/telos-session` (or pick **Telos** in the display manager after installing `telos.desktop`). `telos-session --help` lists environment variables and session keys.

The vault password (and optional FIDO2 key) unlocks an encrypted volume that **becomes `$HOME`** for that session. The LUKS image stays under the **host** home (`TELOS_HOST_HOME`); only session files use the vault mount. Outbound network is denied by default except DNS and IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs in `~/.config/telos/net-allow.txt`. Open the **Network** Telos app to edit that allowlist, enable the **kill-switch** (keeps the session firewall up if WireGuard or Tor stop; not applied on Windows/macOS portable), edit the per-app routing table in `app-routing.txt` (on Linux, **deny** blocks launch from the Telos launcher and **vpn** sets `TELOS_APP_ROUTE=vpn` best-effort — no fake network namespace), store a DoH/DoT/ plain DNS line in `dns.txt`, edit DNS block/allow lists (`dns-block.txt` / `dns-allow.txt`) and an optional NextDNS configuration ID, enable the **Telos DNS stub** (local 127.0.0.1 filter + nftables redirect when privileged apply works), import a WireGuard `.conf` under `~/.config/telos/wireguard/`, or start Tor with data under `~/.config/telos/tor/` (host `tor` / `wg-quick` required). On Linux, a NextDNS ID is applied as DoT through `resolvectl` when available; host lists become enforced when the DNS stub binds and nftables redirect applies. Private keys are never written to `desktop.properties` or logs. Leaving the session locks the vault and removes the `inet telos_session` nftables table. `Ctrl+Alt+L` panic-unmounts and ends labwc.

`./install-telos-de.sh` installs the jar, `telos-session`, and Wayland session entries (`telos.desktop`, `telos-niri.desktop`). Only one session runs at a time. To try labwc inside another Wayland desktop, set `TELOS_ALLOW_NESTED=1`.

On Windows, optional per-user shell replacement (`tools/windows/install-telos-shell.ps1` or Settings → Portable) launches the UberJar at sign-in; revert restores `explorer.exe`.

**OpSec (VOS-6 partial):** Settings and Network → Status show a session audit log under `~/.config/telos/opsec/audit.log` (owner-only). Helix clipboard history (Super+V or the panel clip glyph) keeps up to 20 vault-local items with a 5-minute TTL; pin until lock is optional. Sensitive material (keys/IBAN/WireGuard/card/OTP) is scrubbed from history, vaulted in session memory only, and cleared from the system clipboard — **no cloud sync**. Unlock writes a light host integrity snapshot (OS, compositor, portable flag). When the host has `tpm2-tools`, Settings → OpSec also shows a TPM status line with PCR 0/7 digest summaries (and an optional local quote digest if you place an AK handle at `~/.config/telos/tpm/ak.handle`). Without TPM tools the snapshot records `tpm=unavailable`. This is **not** remote attestation (RAP).

**Session sync / LAN pair (VOS-4) / vault restore (VOS-5 partial):** Network → Status and Settings can export an AES-encrypted session bundle and run a **confirmed** full restore of `desktop.properties` plus `~/.config/telos` (Portable Data / vault HOME paths). WireGuard private keys are never written to logs. **LAN pairing (VOS-4):** Start pairing on Network → Status or Settings to show a short-lived code and `telos-sync://pair?…` URI (private LAN bind only). On the phone open **Telos Sync → Settings**, paste the URI (or enter host, port and code), then Pair. Android stores a pairing token for later fetch/send of the encrypted session zip; codes and tokens are never logged. TLS and mDNS remain optional. Settings can also restore a **LUKS vault image** (`telos_vault.img`) from a user-selected backup while the vault is locked (SHA-256 checked; Telos never mounts it with a password). **Signed updates:** default manifest channel is the GitHub Releases asset `telos-desktop-update.manifest` for `koukomin/Telos-Launcher` (or a saved `file://` / HTTPS URL). Telos verifies the Ed25519 signature and stages the jar under portable/vault temp — install never runs without confirmation. After staging, Settings can offer a **restart helper** that writes a pending-update marker and optional replace script, then exits (swapping a running JVM jar is best-effort). Enter a sync passphrase (or the password from KeePassTL entry **Telos Sync**) and enable auto-import to vault that key for prompt-free boot import. Without a stored sync key, auto-import stays off and boot does not invent credentials. An optional `.kdbx` under `~/.config/telos/sync/keepass.kdbx` can still supply the secret when a master password is provided.

Compose is an xdg-toplevel that labwc pins fullscreen; it is not a native layer-shell client yet.
